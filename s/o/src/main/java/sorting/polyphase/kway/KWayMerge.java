/**
 * T-Way Merge<p>
 *
 * An implementation of "k-Way Merging" as described in
 * "Fundamentals of Data Structures" by Horowitz/Sahni.<p>
 *
 * The idea is to merge k sorted arrays limiting the number of comparisons.
 * A tree is built containing the results of comparing the heads of
 * each array. The top most node is always the smallest entry. Then, its
 * corresponding leaf in the tree is refilled and the tree is processed again.
 * It's easier to see in the following example:<p>
 *
 * Imagine 4 sorted arrays:<br>
 * {5, 10, 15, 20}<br>
 * {10, 13, 16, 19}<br>
 * {2, 19, 26, 40}<br>
 * {18, 22, 23, 24}<p>
 *
 * The initial tree looks like this:<br>
 * <code><pre>
 *           2
 *       /       \
 *     2           5
 *   /   \       /   \
 * 18     2    10     5
 * </pre></code><p>
 *
 * The '/' and '\' represent links. The bottom row are the leaves and they
 * contain the heads of the arrays. The rows above the leaves represent the
 * smaller of the two child nodes. Thus, the top node is the smallest. To process
 * the next iteration, the top node gets popped and its leaf gets refilled. Then,
 * the new leaf's associated nodes are processed. So, after the 2 is taken, it is
 * filled with 19 (the next head of its array). After processing, the tree looks
 * like this:<br>
 * <code><pre>
 *           5
 *       /       \
 *     18          5
 *   /   \       /   \
 * 18    19    10     5
 * </pre></code><p>
 *
 * So, you can see how the number of comparisons is reduced.
 * <p>
 *
 * A good use of this is when you have a very large array that needs to be sorted. Break it up into n small arrays and sort those.
 * Then use this merge sort for the final sort. This can also be done with files. If you have n sorted files, you can merge them into one sorted file.
 * K Way Merging works best when comparing is somewhat expensive.<p>
 * <hr>
 * A note about the iterator. Your iterator class should be defined like this:
<code><pre>
MyIterator implements KWayMergeIterator&lt;MyIterator&gt;
{
// ...
}
</pre></code>
